# PassNet
I have experimented our model with images of seven passport covers of seven different countries from different angles and found an average accuracy rate of 98.56%. Our model can also be enhanced to detect fake and forged passports.

Installation Guideline -
  1. Download and Install Anaconda - https://www.anaconda.com/download/ (make sure you add anaconda to your PATH, you can check it while        installation.)
  2. Clone all the files to your local drive folder. You may name it "PassNet".
  3. Press Shift + Right Click (in mouse) while you are inside your "PassNet" folder. Don't select any file while clicking.
  4. Select "Open Command Window Here"
  5. Write "Jupyter Notebook" in the command prompt
  6. A "Home" tab running in the Localhost will be opened in the browser - http://localhost:8888/tree
  7. Click on Main.ipynb
  8. In a new tab the main file will be opened. Click on "Kernel" from the Menu, and select "Restart and Run All"
  9. Some outputs may differ a bit as there are random values involved.
  10. MAKE SURE PassNet.py, and Main.ipynb - these two files are in the same folder. If not, use relative folder path accordingly while         importing them at the top of the code.
