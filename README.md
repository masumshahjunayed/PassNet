# PassNet
I have experimented our model with images of seven passport covers of seven different countries from different angles and found an average accuracy rate of 98.56%. Our model can also be enhanced to detect fake and forged passports.

Download and Install Anaconda - https://www.anaconda.com/download/ (make sure you add anaconda to your PATH, you can check it while installation.)
Clone all the files to your local drive folder. You may name it "PassNet".
Press Shift + Right Click (in mouse) while you are inside your "PassNet" folder. Don't select any file while clicking.
Select "Open Command Window Here"
Write "Jupyter Notebook" in the command prompt
A "Home" tab running in the Localhost will be opened in the browser - http://localhost:8888/tree
Click on Main.ipynb
In a new tab the main file will be opened. Click on "Kernel" from the Menu, and select "Restart and Run All"
Some outputs may differ a bit as there are random values involved.
MAKE SURE PassNet.py, and Main.ipynb - these two files are in the same folder. If not, use relative folder path accordingly while importing them at the top of the code.
